In this repository you can find various AI basic level projects for your better understanding of AI models from basic level. 


Shakespeare Text Generator
This project uses an LSTM neural network to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare. The model is trained on a large corpus of Shakespeare's works and can generate text based on a seed sequence.

Description
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of LSTM networks for sequence prediction and text generation. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's writings and generates new text based on a given input sequence.
